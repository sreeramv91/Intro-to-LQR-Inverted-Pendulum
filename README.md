# Intro-to-LQR-Inverted-Pendulum
A basic LQR Program in Matlab on inverted Pendulum

The purpose of this project is to understand the concepts which were discussed in the lecture. The project helps in understanding the practical implementation of the concepts to real world scenarios. The main concepts that are covered in the project include the following:

a. Finding the State space model for a non-linear system.

b. Linearizing a nonlinear system

c. Analysing the stability of the system using Lyapunov stability theory

d. Linear state feedback law

e. Combined state feedback controller and estimator

f. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
